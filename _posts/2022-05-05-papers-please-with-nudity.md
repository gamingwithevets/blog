Ahh, Papers Please. The game released in 2013 for Windows and macOS, in 2014 for Linux and iOS, and in 2017 for the PlayStation Vita.  
Papers, Please (or, the PS Vita port, at least, was rated [M for Mature (age 17+) by ESRB](https://www.esrb.org/ratings/36114/Papers%2C+Please/). One of the reasons for the rating is **nudity**.

Now, this game has a setting to turn off nudity and censor the sexual parts of the naked body when searching for weapons and/or contraband.
I personally play with nudity off (and easy mode on since I'm basically a noob with it off), and that's good for me.

But what if... you turn it on? It's on by default, yeah, but what if *you want to see those inappropriate parts of the body*?  
Well, here you go. The left image is Jorji Costava with nudity on (which I censored out), and the right image is Jorji with nudity off.

Most Papers Please playthroughs on the Internet (by that I mean *one*) have nudity on. But of course, your choice doesn't matter. You wanna turn nudity on or off in the game, that's your choice.
