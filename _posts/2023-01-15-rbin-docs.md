# How the Recycle Bin works
First post of 2023!!! Woo!!!

You probably know about the **Recycle Bin** and even use it on a daily basis. But have you ever wondered: how does it even work? You might think "Oh, the files were simply moved to a system folder." But if so, *how does Windows know the file's deletion date?* *How can there be **two** files with the same name in the Recycle Bin?* Well, all those questions will be answered in this blog post.

Some information was taken from [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk8Io_cgYyY) by YouTuber [FlyTech Videos](https://www.youtube.com/@realtechfly) (check him out, he's great!). Also, if FlyTech actually posts about this blog post (which is very unlikely as of posting this) then I will update the blog post with the link to the community post.

NOTE: The below information applies to Windows Vista and higher.

## Where is the Recycle Bin?
You would assume that the Recycle Bin is located in the C: drive, and that's *partially* corrent. When you disable the "Hide protected system files" setting in Windows, you'll see a `$Recycle.Bin` folder in the C: drive, and immediately assume that's where *all* the recycled files go. Again, that's *partially* correct.

But thanks to the great power of testing on a *real system*, I was able to find that Windows will add a `$RECYCLE.BIN` folder in every drive, in addition to the `System Volume Information` folder. But why? Well, let's say you deleted a file in the D: drive. You'll think it'll get sent to the Recycle Bin located in the C: drive, but no, it's actually sent to the D: drive's Recycle Bin. Of course, to hide this, Windows merges items from every Recycle Bin into one listing.

Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the fact that in each Recycle Bin folder, there are... **multiple Recycle Bins** that always lead to one single Recycle Bin. If you use the Command Prompt and `dir /a` in that directory you will see at least three folders, all starting with `S-1-5-`. These are known as security identifiers, or SIDs. You can get yours by typing `wmic useraccount where name="%username%" get sid` into the Command Prompt or PowerShell.

## Inside the Recyle Bin
Once you get inside a Recycle Bin... "wait, how do I know which item is which?" For every deleted item Windows creates two files: a file with some metadata on it, and another with the actual file/folder data, normally used for restoring the deleted item. The metadata files always have their name start with `$I`, and the data files/folders always have their name start with `$R`. What comes after are a randomized 6-character string (each character can be 0-9, A-Z, or a-z), and the file extension (determined by what comes after the final `.` in the original file name, folders also have their "extension" determined). What comes after `$I` (for metadata files) and `$R` (for data files) **must match**, or else the item won't show up at all.

### The metadata files
FlyTech didn't inspect the Recycle Bin on older versions of Windows, so *I did*. It turns out that the first 8 bytes of the metadata files determine the version number, and not actually a "header". Each version has different formatting from one another, so let's dive in!

#### Version 1
*Used in: Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1*  
PS:  
Although Windows 10 and higher won't create v1 metadata files anymore, you can still create them yourself and Windows will actually read them just fine. This is probably so that users won't get angry because their recycled stuff "mysteriously disappeared" after upgrading to Windows 10 or 11.  
*tl-dr*: Windows 10 and above can still read v1 metadata files for backwards compatibility.

| Hex location | Byte size (in hex) | Format/Endianness | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| 0x0 | 0x8 | Little-endian | Version number (1 in this case). |
| 0x8 | 0x8 | Little-endian | File size (in bytes). (redundant as Windows can simply get the data files' file size) |
| 0x10 | 0x8 | Little-endian | Deletion date (in [file time format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/file-times)). |
| 0x18 | 0x208 | UTF-16 LE | Original file path and name. (last character is always 0x00, empty character spaces have 0x00 characters) |

#### Version 2
*Used in: Windows 10, 11*

| Hex location | Byte size (in hex) | Format/Endianness | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| 0x0 | 0x8 | Little-endian | Version number (2 in this case). |
| 0x8 | 0x8 | Little-endian | File size (in bytes). (redundant as Windows can simply get the data files' file size) |
| 0x10 | 0x8 | Little-endian | Deletion date (in [file time format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/file-times)). |
| 0x18 | 0x4 | Little-endian | Length of original file path and name. |
| 0x1C | 0x10+ | UTF-16 LE | Original file path and name. (last character is always 0x00) |

## RBEditor (self-promotion)
**RBEditor** is a tool that can edit the Recycle Bin's contents and also open and edit files and folders inside the Recycle Bin.
