# How I Talk in Discord

So, you might've heard about these Discord scams going around, and you might see that someone in your friends list "told" you that either you sent [NSFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work) stuff to your girlfriend which were leaked on a server, or money-related stuff. Either way the message will have a link to a Discord server, which is where all the scamming takes place.

So, how do you... not get fooled by a message, supposedly from someone in your friends list? Well, one way I could think of is to **let your friends know how you talk on Discord**! And that's what I'm doing right now. Also, why not [join my Discord server](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/redirector/discord.html) and share how *you* talk on Discord? This way, if someone got access to your Discord token and your friends recieve a scam message from you, they can **identify if that's the real you**!

So, here's how I talk on Discord:
1. Like most people, I don't use capitalization and use slangs to talk (e.g. `i like u` instead of `I like you`).
2. I don't cuss. Everyone (except little kiddos) knows that ~~we don't talk about~~ cussing is bad. When I do cuss, I use **emojis** for censoring. No special characters like asterisks! Plus, that's one of my server rules.
3. I don't send messages about money-related stuff, except when talking about scams. I also don't usually say someone that they sent some NSFW stuff.
4. I never send random Discord server invites, only my server invites. That's also one of my server rules!
